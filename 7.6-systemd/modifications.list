This is a list of all modifications I remember making to what's written in the book:

* I didn't chown /tools to root:root
* /sbin, /usr/sbin and /bin are a symlink to /usr/bin
* /lib64 and /lib are a symlink to /usr/lib
* linux-headers-3.16.5 instead of 3.16.2
* man-pages: remove getspnam.3 and passwd.5
* zlib: didn't move libz.so.* to /lib because /lib symlinks to /usr/lib
* gcc: move /usr/lib*/*.gdb.py instead of /usr/lib/*gdb.py
* bzip2: didn't do the last 3 lines described in the book and modified the 3 before them so that things get installed to /usr/lib and /usr/bin
* ncurses: didn't move libraries from /usr/lib to /lib ( first line after make install )
* attr and acl: didn't move library to /lib
* libcap: didn't move library to /lib and sed Make.Rules
* sed: configure without --bindir
* shadow: copy all executables to /usr/bin
* psmisc: didn't move executables to /bin
* procps-ng: didn't move binaries to /lib and /bin (last 3 lines)
* e2fsprogs: no --bindir, copy binaries and libraries to /usr/{bin,lib}
* coreutils: didn't move binaries to /bin
* grep: without --bindir
* readline: didn't move libraries to /lib
* bash: move binaries to /usr/bin
* inetutils: didn't move binaries to /bin and /sbin
* perl: didn't create /etc/hosts
* findutils: didn't move binaries to /bin
* xz: didn't move binaries and libraries to /bin | /lib
* gzip: without --bindir and didn't move binaries
* kmod: without --bindir and --with-rootlibdir also didn't create symlinks
* systemd:
	- KILL=/usr/bin/kill
	- without --with-rootlibdir and --with-rootprefix
	- without --enable-split-usr
	- without for loop that links binaries 
	- don't move libnss*
* dbus: didn't move libraries
* util-linux: removed /sbin/nologin and it's manpage because it conflicts with shadow
