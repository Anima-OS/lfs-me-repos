In this file I'll collect some problems I encountered while installing (B)LFS and the appropriate fixes that worked for me.

No icons
--------
I had the Problem that PNG-Icons didn't work with GTK applications. I fixed by updating the MIME cache with "update-mime-database /usr/share/mime"

Not being able to change password
---------------------------------
When passwd didn't let me change a user's password, I fixed it with pwconv.
