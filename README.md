lfs-me-repos
============

**lfs-me-repos** is a collection of PKGBUILD files for [lfs-me](https://github.com/FSMaxB/lfs-me) (further instructions can be found there).

When you are using those PKGBUILD files to build your *LFS* or *BLFS* system, be sure to follow the appropriate instructions and don't use the PKGBUILD files without understanding them and modifying them to fit your needs. In most cases you will have to change the configure flags in order to build/not build some dependencies you want/don't want, and you might want to customise other things.

I want to be clear that this is no collection of every package that is available in LFS or BLFS but only those that I personally used to build my system. I also want to make clear that many of the packages may contain errors, so please check them before using them.
